            <h2>Mentality Tips</h2>
            <p>A  good mentality can be a game changer if you’re looking to rack up those tickets. That’s why it’s important to keep these tips in mind</p>
    
            <h5>Try to stay positive</h5>
            <p>   If you are planning on playing for a long stretch of time then it is crucial to stay positive. In my experience, when I let a game get to me where I was frustratingly close to winning or where I think something unfair happened, I usually start playing worse in the following games. This then starts a vicious cycle of playing worse and worse and getting more and more upset about it. This leads into the next tip.</p>
    
            <h5>Don’t be afraid to call it for the day</h5>
            <p>   If your end goal is to save up tickets for a larger prize then you would probably be planning on coming back. So, if a certain day at the arcade isn’t going as well as you would hope, then don’t afraid to call it quits and save your money for a day where you may be in a better head space.</p>
    
            <h2>Arcade Tips</h2>
            <p> If you are wanting to to get really into arcade gaming then finding the right arcade is a good first step. In my experience some arcades just won’t have the machines you are looking for or the machine might just be worse at a certain arcade. Some machines may have significantly lower ticket payouts for getting a high score or the prizes may not be as good. So before you start looking to save up some tickets, make sure you’re doing it at the best spot
                available. If you find a really good arcade then there may be items like gaming consoles, I Pads, headphones, speakers, etc. in your future.</p>
    
            <h5>Picking the right spot</h5>
            <p>One specific chain of arcades that has been good to me is called Play Joy. This company goes and sets up little arcades at places like malls or amusement parks and has a giant vending machine that dispenses the prizes. The nice thing about these arcades is that the tickets carry over between locations. Knowing this I was able to save up tickets at a location closer to me and then drive a bit further and get a Nintendo Switch OLED when there was only a Switch Lite available at the one near me.</p>
    
            <h5>Use your tickets</h5>
            <p> Another useful trick that I found out the hard was was that at some arcades the digital tickets system that they use allows tickets to expire if they aren’t used within a certain time frame. For my arcade this time frame was a year and because I wasn’t aware of this until it was too late I ended up losing 80,000 tickets. So just be careful with how long you store your tickets without using them.</p>
