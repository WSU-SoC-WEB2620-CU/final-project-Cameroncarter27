                    <p> Crossy Road is an infinite runner game in the same vein as Subway Surfers or Temple Run and
                        takes
                        significant influence from the classic arcade game Frogger. The game is a play on the classic
                        chicken crossing the road joke and as such it focuses on the player trying to make their way
                        across
                        busy
                        streets, train tracks, and rivers. Crossy Road started as a phone game but was eventually
                        altered
                        and turned into an arcade game. The arcade version of this game is one that I have a significant
                        amount of experience with. As such, I have found it to be one of the best, if not the best,
                        games
                        for racking up high amounts of tickets. </p>

                    <p>To get the full value out of each game the player must beat a certain score which then rewards
                        them
                        with a bonus that stacks on top of the player’s current score. I have seen this bonus range from
                        250
                        to 1,000 extra tickets on top of the score of around 150 to 200 that it takes for the player to
                        achieve this bonus. It is because of this high volume of tickets that is achievable each game
                        that
                        this particular game has become by far my favorite. From what I have seen it is the most
                        consistent
                        if you are looking to save up tickets over time. In my time playing this game there have been
                        some
                        fundamental tips that I employ every game to help me achieve my high scores. Those tips are the
                        following.</p>
                    <ul class="list-group">
                        <li class="list-group-item">
                            <h5>Stay in the middle</h5>
                            <p>Always try to stay in the middle of the screen. This helps to prevent you from being
                                caught off guard
                                by a car coming on screen or log moving too fast off of the screen.</p>
                        </li>
                        <li class="list-group-item">
                            <h5>Be patient but decisive</h5>
                            <p>When approaching a road with several lanes you don’t want to rush into the road
                                unless there is immediately a clear path. Take a little bit of time to plan a route or
                                wait for a
                                gap to open.
                                When you do decide to go, try not to hesitate when you see a path but also don’t be
                                afraid to change
                                your route on the fly if things play out differently than you intended.</p>
                        </li>
                        <li class="list-group-item">
                            <h5>Be careful with train tracks</h5>
                            <p> One of the more common ways for a run to end is by not being careful with the trains.
                                While most
                                other
                                aspects of this game can be overcome through skill, with trains that isn’t always the
                                case as even
                                if you’re
                                careful they can still screw up a game. So, to minimize the chances of getting hit by a
                                train you
                                should
                                first see if there’s a stretch of land before the tracks that you can stand on away from
                                danger. If
                                possible
                                you will want to get at least one train to activate as the track that that train was on
                                will now be
                                train free
                                and safe for awhile.</p>

                            <p> If you can’t wait for a train to go when there are multiple tracks then always start by
                                standing on
                                the
                                first track as this strategy gives you the most options for escape. For example, if the
                                track you’re
                                on lights
                                up then you just need to hop to the next one while if the track in front of you lights
                                up then
                                you’re already
                                good to go! There are scenarios where luck may not be on your side and all tracks light
                                up at once.
                                In this
                                scenario the only thing you can do is hurry and get off the tracks but you have to be
                                quick. In
                                general
                                though the strategies I’ve outlined here are the best ways to go.</p>

            <div class="d-lg-flex flex-row">
                <div class="text-center p-2">
                    <img src="./images/quik-drop.jpg" alt="Crossy Road">
                </div>

                <div class="p-2">
                    <p>Quik Drop is a game that revolves around dropping all 50 allotted balls
                        into several moving holes. The more balls that you make into the
                        holes, the more tickets you get. You want to make sure to go fast as
                        each round is timed so you can’t take too long or the game will end.
                        Another key aspect of this game is timing. If you drop a ball in the
                        wrong spot then it’ll miss or bounce away from the cylinder thus
                        ruining any chance of getting the jackpot. To get the jackpot on this
                        game you have to get every single one of the 50 balls into the holes.
                        This task can prove to be pretty difficult because, depending on the
                        the current jackpot value, the time limit provided to drop the balls
                        could be as low as 20-22 seconds with it eventually maxing at 30
                        seconds. </p>

                    <p> The time limit will eventually start to increase as more people play
                        the game without winning the jackpot. If the jackpot isn’t won during
                        a certain game then it’s value will increase for the next game until
                        someone eventually wins it. If the value of the jackpot is in the 500 to
                        around 650/700 range then in most locations the game will be in a sort
                        of “hard mode” as the time limit will be at it’s lowest. When the game is
                        in this mode the player will have to drop 4 balls in 10 of the holes and 5
                        in the other two. The timing on this is tight but it is possible to win
                        every round if you get it down.</p>

                    <p>As the jackpot gets past the 650/700 range then it becomes easier
                        as you will now only have to get 5 balls in one hole and 4 balls in the
                        other 11. This mode lasts until the jackpot is around 800 and
                        then it gets easier again. In the final mode when the jackpot is
                        anywhere in the 800 to 1000 range you should only have to get 4 balls
                        in the 12 holes without having to worry about sneaking in a 5th.</p>

                    <p> If you are able to get these patterns down then this game is one of the best for saving up

                        The games on
                        this machine go faster than Crossy Road games so if you are able to get consistent with this
                        game
                        then it will allow
                        you to build up tickets extremely fast but just potentially at a higher cost than if you were to

                        your time on playing something like Crossy Road. </p>

            <h2>Deal or No Deal</h2>
            <div class="p-2">
                <p> Deal or No Deal is a seemingly luck based game in which you are shown several suitcases with various
                    ticket
                    values. You are then tasked with trying to follow the highest value case around so you can choose it
                    as your
                    case and get the highest ticket value possible. The problem is that the cases are shuffled around at
                    high speeds
                    thus making it almost impossible to follow with the naked eye. This makes the outcome of this game
                    often
                    subpar as you have to be very lucky or have a very keen eye to end up getting the higher value
                    cases.</p>

                <p> However, if you are looking to get the highest value case each game there is a little trick that you
                    can employ.
                    While it is kind of a hack it does work pretty good. The trick here is to pull out your phone and
                    record the
                    animation of the cases getting shuffled around. You can then take this video and make the cases
                    significantly
                    easier to follow by putting the video in slow motion. You’ll want to make sure your video is slow
                    enough to allow
                    you to follow the case but fast enough that you can watch it and find the desired cases position
                    before the
                    allotted time to pick your case is up.</p>

                <p> If you do miss the time frame to pick your case then it’s not the end of the world. You probably
                    will end up
                    with a lower amount of tickets as the final deal given by the banker will be an average of the two
                    cases left. This
                    basically makes it impossible for it to be higher than the highest value case but it will still give
                    you a
                    respectable amount tickets.</p>

                <p> In terms of overall ticket output, the other games mentioned on this page will usually provide you
                    with
                    significantly more tickets if you are able to master them. However, if the more skill based games
                    really aren’t
                    your cup of tea but you still want a good amount of tickets then this is pretty solid game to check
                    out.</p>
