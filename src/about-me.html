                    <p> Hi, I’m Cameron and for as long as I can remember I have loved going to arcades! They have always
                        had a
                        very special place in my heart as they have been my chosen spot for several birthdays, hang out
                        sessions
                        with friends, dates, or fun evenings with my family. I would say I was always a fan of arcades but
                        my
                        increased
                        interest in them came in the seventh grade during a field trip. While on this field trip I noticed
                        that
                        the
                        arcade
                        we were at had a Crossy Road machine which I had had on my phone for awhile and was a really big fan
                        of
                        so
                        I decided to play it. Well the arcade version works by having you try to beat a certain score which
                        then
                        gives
                        you a jackpot and on this trip I kept getting really close. I knew I could beat the score if I just
                        put
                        more
                        time into
                        the game and so that’s exactly what I did. Every time I came back to that arcade I would immediately
                        go
                        to
                        Crossy Road. I started winning more and more consistently and getting all-time high score after
                        all-time
                        high
                        score until I eventually saved up 65,000 tickets and won a Nintendo Switch. This made my interest in
                        the
                        arcade sky-rocket as I now knew if I just put in the time and effort I could win the big prizes that
                        I
                        had
                        always
                        dreamed of getting when I was younger. So I kept playing and playing and winning more and more until
                        I
                        won
                        an X Box and then a Playstation and then two more X Boxes and two more Switches etc. Now, I’m
                        looking to
                        help others do what I do and that’s exactly why I made this website, to give guides to people that
                        allow
                        them
                        to improve their skills at certain arcade games and win those big prizes that have been begging to
                        be
                        won
                        for
                        so long!</p>
